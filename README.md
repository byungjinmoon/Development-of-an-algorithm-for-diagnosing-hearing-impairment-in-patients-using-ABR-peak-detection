This algorithm is implemented in matlab.

# Background 

* Development of an algorithm for diagnosing hearing impairment in patients using ABR peak detection

  ABR (auditory brainstorm response) observes stimulation by sound waves through EEG and is used as a diagnosis for hearing threshold or auditory nerve tumors.

  Brain stimulation through sound waves can be observed through EEG, and the presence or absence of hearing loss can be determined through latency and the location of EEG peak points dependent to the stimulus intensity of sound waves.
  
  * Purpose
  
    The purpose of this research is to develop an algorithm that helps in diagnosing hearing impairment by detect ing ABR peaks.
    
# Experimental results

* Preprocess of the data
  * Digitalization for the ABR data
    
    First, for signal analysis, image data was digitalized into 1-dimension ABR wave.<br>
      EX) 75dB<br>
